## [Query collection hierarchies](query-collection-hierarchies.md)

+ Queries should be organised into a Query Collection Hierarchy
+ Tables within the same collection can use an underscore to indicate their hierarchy
+ Related tables should use an underscore to indicate their hierarchy

## [Casing](casing.md)

+ Tables should use `PascalCase`
+ Columns should use `camelCase`
+ Primary keys should be called `id`

## [Naming](naming.md)

+ Column names should be treated exactly as object properties are
+ Foreign key column names do not need special identification
+ Foreign key constraint names should reference both tables and columns uniquely
