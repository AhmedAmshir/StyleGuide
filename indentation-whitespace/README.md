# Indentation and whitespace.

## [Tabs](tabs.md).

+ Use the tab character for indentation, set to 4 spaces wide.

## [Double-indenting](double-indenting.md).

+ Avoid "double-indenting" blocks of code where no indentation is necessary for readability.

## [Line length](line-length.md).

+ Do not leave whitespace at the end of lines.
+ Be as strict as is sensible to enforce 80 character lines.
