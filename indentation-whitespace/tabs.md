# Tabs

## Use the tab character for indentation, set to 4 spaces wide.

Indentation is done using tabs, via the tab key, so the tab character should be used. The width of a tab character is configurable in editors, whereas this feature is lost if spaces were used.

Tab characters that follow word characters on a line will automatically grow to the width of the next tab stop. Adding or removing characters before a tab will never break the tab stops. When using spaces for tabs, changing the contents of the line before a tab will mess up the tab stops on that line. Example: aligning array value assignments.

Programmers who can't change their coding style from spaces to tabs can use any decent editor to automatically convert between spaces and tabs to ensure the code is being committed in the same style as the guidelines for the repository prescribe.
