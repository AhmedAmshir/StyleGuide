# Tabs

## Use the tab character for indentation, set to 4 columns wide.

Tabs visually indicate the current block's level of indentation, assisting readability by being set to a particular column width. A tab character's width can be dynamically set, while consistently maintaining a single level of indentation.

Using tabs also allows tab stops to be respected. Tab characters that follow word characters on a line will automatically grow to the width of the next tab stop. Adding or removing characters before a tab will never break the tab stops. When using spaces for tabs, changing the contents of the line before a tab will mess up the tab stops on that line. Example: aligning array value assignments.

It's impossible to semi-indent something using tab characters.

Programmers who can't change their coding style from spaces to tabs can use any decent editor to automatically convert between spaces and tabs to ensure the code is being committed in the same style as the guidelines for the repository prescribe.
