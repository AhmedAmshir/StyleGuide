# Line length

## Do not leave whitespace at the end of lines.

Git will warn you about patches that introduce trailing whitespace, and can optionally strip the trailing whitespace for you; however, if applying a series of patches, this may make later patches in the series fail by changing their context lines.

## Be as strict as is sensible to enforce 80 character lines.

// TODO.

## Limit to four levels of indentation.

// TODO.
